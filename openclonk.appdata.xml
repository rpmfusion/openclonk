    <p>
      OpenClonk is a free multiplayer action game in which you control clonks,
      small but witty and nimble humanoid beings. The game is mainly about mining,
      settling and fast-paced melees.
      OpenClonk is not just a game but also a versatile 2D game engine that allows
      the creation of mods. It is the successor of the shareware game series Clonk
      and thus inherits many of its features.
